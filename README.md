# Java Evening Meetup


#### Description
This project served as example for the Java Evening Meetup on November 28th in Saint Petersburg powered by STC team.

This code does basic interaction with ActiveMQ and Amazon SQS. 

You can find a presentation presented on the meetup.

#### Code

`Main` class contains whole work flow about MQ interaction. We create a consumer, set message handler and launch it. 
On the other hand we have producer which sends some messages. You can experiment with that as you wish, for instance you could do your own message handler and etc.
